Difference Between LIST&HASHSET:

LIST:
=======================================================
1.List is an ordered list. 

2.It is accessed by an integer index

3.It  contain duplicates

4.It has a predictable order,Store a collection of items in a certain order. 

5.A List<T> is a class designed to give you a collection with O(1) random access than can grow dynamically (think dynamic array).

6.You can test containment in O(n) time (unless the list is sorted)

7.Then you can do a binary search in O(log n) time).



 HASTSET:
======================================================================

1.HashSet is like a dictionary 

2.The item itself is the key as well as the value,unordered

3.HashSet is a List with no duplicate members.

4.HashSet is constrained to contain only unique entries, the internal structure is optimised for searching (compared with a list) - it is considerably faster

5.Adding to a HashSet returns a boolean - false if addition fails due to already existing in Set

6.It Can perform mathematical set operations against a Set: Union/Intersection/IsSubsetOf etc.

7.HashSet doesn't implement IList only ICollection

8.You cannot use indices with a HashSet, only enumerators.

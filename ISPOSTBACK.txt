
ISPOSTBACK:--
========================================================
every time you bind DropDownList, selectedindex will be reset. if you want to bind DropDownList from database in page_load event, you only need to bind it one time only to avoid selection reset. Bind it in not ispostback only.


One way to do this is to extend the ASP.NET Page class, "override"

IsPostBack property and let all your pages derive from the extended page.

It checks the Request.Form collection to see if it is non-empty.
